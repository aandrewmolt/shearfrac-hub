# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Instructions

Your Well Rig Visualizer is now configured to run **without Supabase**! It's ready to deploy to Vercel in just a few clicks.

## Current Configuration

- **Database Mode**: Local (IndexedDB)
- **Authentication**: Automatic (no login required)
- **Cost**: $0 (completely free)
- **Data Storage**: Browser local storage

## Deploy to Vercel (2 minutes)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for local mode deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Click "Deploy" (all settings are pre-configured)

3. **That's it!** Your app will be live in ~1 minute

## How It Works

- **No Database Setup**: Uses browser's IndexedDB
- **No Authentication**: Automatically logs in users
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection
- **Zero Configuration**: Everything works out of the box

## Features Available

‚úÖ Create and manage cable jobs  
‚úÖ Equipment inventory management  
‚úÖ Job diagrams with drag-and-drop  
‚úÖ Equipment allocation and tracking  
‚úÖ Offline operation  
‚úÖ Photo uploads (stored locally)

## Limitations

‚ùå No multi-user support (each browser has its own data)  
‚ùå No sync between devices  
‚ùå Data only stored in browser (clear browser data = lose data)  

## Future Upgrades

When you're ready for multi-user support, you can easily upgrade to:

1. **Vercel Postgres** ($10-15/month)
2. **Neon Database** (Free up to 3GB)
3. **Turso** (Free tier available)

Just change `VITE_DATABASE_MODE` in Vercel's environment variables.

## Testing Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:8319

## Support

The app is configured to work immediately without any setup. If you need help upgrading to a cloud database later, refer to the `DEPLOYMENT_QUICKSTART.md` file.
